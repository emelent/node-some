# Mind Readers

Spent way too much time on this... way too much..


## Classes:


### Thought
    A thought contains a name, and a probability

### Mind
    Represents a mind, with thoughts that can be added or removed, with
	a method called thinkAboutAThought which selects the most probable thought.

	
	
### MindReader
    A MindReader takes an errorMargin as a parameter, the higher the error margin
	the higher the chance of an incorrect guess
